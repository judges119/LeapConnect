LeapConnect
===========

Interfaces for using Leap Motion with Unity, suitable for different versions of the API and containing separate features. Rather than simply modify the same file in separate commits I've uploaded the libraries separately to make them more visible to users who may still be using older versions of the SDK.

LeapConnect2 is for the original SDK, LeapConnect3 was for the private beta and provides an interface featuring two separate "hand structures" labelled left_hand and right_hand while LeapConnect4 uses the public Skeletal Tracking API beta and features a "hands structure" array where the length is a constant the developer can modify.
